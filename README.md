Introduction

UC San Diego offers numerous dining halls, each with its own selection of food items, for students to purchase meals with their Dining Dollars. However, with so many food items to choose from, students may wonder which items are better than others and which ones they should avoid. In addition, they may be unsure as to how to budget their Dining Dollars so that they don’t run out by the end of the school year. With YEAT @ UCSD, students can not only see and contribute to the rating of food items, but they’ll also be able to personalize their experience with food preferences, personal favorites, and spending recommendations.
